## Content

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes
 - Coding standards and processes
 - Version control standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

## Documentation standards and processes
Standards
- Documentation will be done according to the Professor David Wessels choice in terms of file types and formatting.
- There will be no tools used for grammer checking.
- All Documents will be Proofread by each member at least once to make it final.
- Documents will be discussed by all members in due time and to avoid conflict all members must bring there concerns up immediatly.

any templates or guidelines you'll be following (a url/link is fine if you're following an existing industry standard),
any rules/tools to be used in spelling and grammar checking,
how you'll check/proofread each other's writing to ensure it follows the standards,
how you'll coordinate putting the parts together if different people are writing different sections of a document (and ensure it can all be done in time for the submission deadlines)

Detail the documentation standards and processes to be followed (can provide links to existing industry standards), how they will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for updating if/as needed.
