## Content

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes
 - Coding standards and processes
 - Version control standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

## Documentation standards and processes
Standards
- Documentation will be done according to the Professor David Wessels choice in terms of file types and formatting.
- There will be no tools used for grammer checking.
- All Documents will be proofread by each member at least once to make it final.
- Documents will be discussed by all members in due time and to avoid conflict all members must bring there concerns up immediatly.

Processes
- The Documentation will be divided to be an equal load upon all members.
- The Documentation will be worked on seperatly or as a group as needed.
- All Documents will be proofread by every member during a meeting.


## Coding standards and processes
Standards
- The team is going to work with the game engine named Godot(Link: https://godotengine.org ).
- The team will be using GDScript within Godot for all programming realted work.
- GDScipt has it's own coding standards with indentation and Syntax.

  Processes
- The Team will be working together on the 3D Arcade hub world and complete this within Godot.
- The team will then split up and work separatly on each game within the arcade.
- After each game is working as intended, the Visual head will take over and create Sprite's and other front end work for each game.
- The Final playtest will be done by team members in order to test for any bugs in each game and the hub world as well.

## Version control standards and processes
Standards
- The Version Control will be handled by Marek understudied by Bruce.
- The Version control will work in a 5 Branch System.
  - The Master Branch will be our Main branch with only working versions.
  - The Feature Branch will be the working branch for members to work on indivisual features.
  - The Development Branch is an amalgamation of multiple features from the feature branch.
  - The Release Branch will have Developed versions of the product ready for testing.
  - The Hotfix Branch is for sudden hotfixes to be made to the master branch when and if neccessary. If a hotfix is made this version will be sent to the next version of the Master Branch and Development Branch.
- If anybody does not adhere to the version control system proposed or make a mistake they will have to spin the wheel of punishments and bare a fitting punishment.

Processes
- The Version Control is handled by Marek and Bruce.
- To Develop a feature, pull from developer branch.
- Develop your feature in the local feature branch.
- Pull from developer once more to check that you are up to date.(If not fix inconsistencies. 
- Communicate that you will make a push, Marek or Bruce will merge the new feature into the developer branch.
- After the development of multiple features is complete, a pull request will be made from the Release branch.
- The Release branch will then be tested and edited to fix any bugs. If bugs are too big then it will be pushed back to the development branch.
- Upon all tests being completed, the version will be sent to the main/master branch and development branch for new features.
- If the main/master branch has a massive problem/bug it will be pulled into the hotfix branch and the fix will be made as soon as possible. After this, the new version will be pushed into both the main and development branch.
- The development branch will now be taking the hotfix and incorporate this with any new features added.
