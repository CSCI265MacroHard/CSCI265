## Content

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

- Documents will be discussed by all members in due time and to avoid conflict all members must bring there concerns up immediatly.

Processes
-The Documentation will be divided to be an equal load upon all members.
-The Documentation will be worked on seperatly or as a group as needed.
-All Documents will be proofread by every member during a meeting.
