## Content

In this document we will be addressing three core areas of standards and processes:
 - Documentation standards and processes
 - Coding standards and processes
 - Version control standards and processes

Each section includes discussion of how those standards/processes will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for potential updates if/as needed.

## Documentation standards and processes
Standards
- Documentation will be done according to the Professor David Wessels choice in terms of file types and formatting.
- There will be no tools used for grammer checking.
- All Documents will be Proofread by each member at least once to make it final.
- Documents will be discussed by all members in due time and to avoid conflict all members must bring there concerns up immediatly.

Processes
- The Documentation will be divided to be an equal load upon all members.
- The Documentation will be worked on seperatly or as a group as needed.
- All Documents will be proofread by every member during a meeting.


## Coding standards and processes
Standards
- The team is going to work with the game engine named Godot(Link: https://godotengine.org ).
- The team will be using GDScript within Godot for all programming realted work.
- GDScipt has it's own coding standards with indentation and Syntax.

  Processes
- The Team will be working together on the 3D Arcade hub world and complete this within Godot.
- The team will then split up and work separatly on each game within the arcade.
- After each game is working as intended, the Visual head will take over and create Sprite's and other front end work for each game.
- The Final playtest will be done by team members in order to test for any bugs in each game and the hub world as well.
Detail the coding standards and processes to be followed (can provide links to existing industry standards), how they will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for updating if/as needed.

## Version control standards and processes

Detail the version control standards and processes to be followed, how they will be enforced, and how they will be reviewed for updating if/as needed.
