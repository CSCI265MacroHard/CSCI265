# CSCI 265 Requirements and specifications (Phase 2)

## Team name: YOUR TEAM NAME HERE

## Project/product name: YOUR PRODUCT NAME HERE

## Contact person and email

The following person has been designated the main contact person for questions from the reader:

 - Alister Lawson, alisteremail@gmail.com
   

## Introduction and overview

Provide the reader with an introduction to the product: its purpose, its core features, what audience it is aimed at and how they'll be using it, and what platform(s) it is targeting.

If the product has limitations that the user wouldn't expect then those should be mentioned as well.  (For example, if we were building a calculator but it couldn't handle real number calculations then we should probably warn the reader about that.)

## Product features and behaviour

This might be much like our original proposal but in far greater detail: we want to thoroughly explain/describe all aspects of the product's functionality: all the features and every aspect of its behaviour.

Here the reader should should be able to find the answer for any question along the lines of
- How do I use feature X?
- How do I enter data value Y?
- What are the limits (if any) on what I enter for Z?
- What does the product do if I enter an incorrect value?
- What happens when I select W?"

This section should be intuitive to follow if the reader is simply reading through the document to learn about the product, but it should also make it easy for the reader to quickly look up the answer to any specific question.

## User interface and navigation

Provide visual depictions of every screen, menu, drop-down, pop-up, etc.  This isn't intended to be a to-the-pixel exact representation, but it is expected to show all the visible elements and options, and their approximate positions and appearance.

Accompany each visual depiction with a clear description of what it shows and what each visible option represents.

Provide a navigation guide/map and description that show how all the screens/menus etc relate to one another: i.e. clearly showing/describing how the user navigates from screen-to-screen and which screens/choices lead to which others.

## Use cases/scenarios

Provide use cases detailing the different ways someone might actually want to use the product (e.g. a "sign in" use case, a "check balance" use case, a "make a deposit" use case, etc).

Provide scenarios that illustrate the use cases in a practical example.  (E.g. Bob has $30 to deposit and wants to deposit it, check the balance, and if there is enough then transfer $100 to his savings account, ... then walk through the Bob's actions from sign-in to sign-out.)

## Non-functional requirements

Detail any requirements beyond the actual feature set previously required, e.g.
- safety/security/privacy requirements
- performance requirements (response times, throughput, memory footprint)
- software quality requirements

## Feature prioritization

Much like the scaling section in the original proposal, here we must document which features are regarded as essential, which ones are secondary priorities, and which ones are 'nice to have' but low priority for this term.

## Glossary

Define any product-specific terms and any terms that are unlikely to be known to the 'average' reader (e.g. a random second-year CS student).

## Appendices
