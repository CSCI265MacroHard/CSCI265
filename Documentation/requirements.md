## Known issues/ Ommisions <a name="section1"></a>

As movements are already pre-determined for the arcade, the actual interface of the booth itself has not been talked about yet. In addition, the implementation of the mini-games in the arcade has not been brought up, as well as the amount and type of games that each member will bring to the table are not yet finalized. Games such as Pool, Street Fighter, and Vampire Survivors, each have their own set of progress has not been set in motion. Hence, raising a concern about the visuals as well as the Godot process. All of these will be rectified once the phase of development starts, and the team is already focused on the project and programming. 

No errors and changes to the plan and interface were raised, but the group made notes on blame, pull, and push on git in case a member did such corrupt a document.

## Introduction and overview

Provide the reader with an introduction to the product: its purpose, its core features, what audience it is aimed at and how they'll be using it, and what platform(s) it is targeting.

If the product has limitations that the user wouldn't expect then those should be mentioned as well.  (For example, if we were building a calculator but it couldn't handle real number calculations then we should probably warn the reader about that.)

## Product features and behaviour

This might be much like our original proposal but in far greater detail: we want to thoroughly explain/describe all aspects of the product's functionality: all the features and every aspect of its behaviour.

Here the reader should should be able to find the answer for any question along the lines of
- How do I use feature X?
- How do I enter data value Y?
- What are the limits (if any) on what I enter for Z?
- What does the product do if I enter an incorrect value?
- What happens when I select W?"

This section should be intuitive to follow if the reader is simply reading through the document to learn about the product, but it should also make it easy for the reader to quickly look up the answer to any specific question.

## User interface and navigation

Provide visual depictions of every screen, menu, drop-down, pop-up, etc.  This isn't intended to be a to-the-pixel exact representation, but it is expected to show all the visible elements and options, and their approximate positions and appearance.

Accompany each visual depiction with a clear description of what it shows and what each visible option represents.

Provide a navigation guide/map and description that show how all the screens/menus etc relate to one another: i.e. clearly showing/describing how the user navigates from screen-to-screen and which screens/choices lead to which others.

## Use cases/scenarios

Provide use cases detailing the different ways someone might actually want to use the product (e.g. a "sign in" use case, a "check balance" use case, a "make a deposit" use case, etc).

Provide scenarios that illustrate the use cases in a practical example.  (E.g. Bob has $30 to deposit and wants to deposit it, check the balance, and if there is enough then transfer $100 to his savings account, ... then walk through the Bob's actions from sign-in to sign-out.)

## Non-functional requirements

Detail any requirements beyond the actual feature set previously required, e.g.
- safety/security/privacy requirements
- performance requirements (response times, throughput, memory footprint)
- software quality requirements

## Feature prioritization <a name="section7"></a>

As the group presented our proposal from Phase 1, there's a lot to wrap around initiating an arcade environment. This includes building each component from scratch, but assets that are available online could also help. However, a great deal of uncertainty to what elements are able to complete in just a 4-month duration are still a problem.

Core Aspects
As highlighted briefly from the last presentation on risks, we are scaling down the process to a point where the group found these aspects as a success:

- at least 3 games, 
- at least 2-3 Non Playable Character (NPC) to initiate the arcade vibe,
- a working booth for token exchange,
- background retro music,
- game progress are saved, and
- a workable arcade environment (2D).

Secondary Features

In case the group still have time to make more features:

- more NPCs that could interact,
- more games,
- 3D arcade environment (this is being working progress already but a falldown for a 2D is applicable),
- a good UX for the game and booth, and
- higher detailed character visuals for games (the group was thinking of lower bit).

Stretch goals

As the project itself sounds like a stretch already for just one semester, these feature are a great addition to the initial version and provide more experience for users.

- multiplayer
- developers can add their games
- rankings
- more prizes
- chat box

## Glossary

Define any product-specific terms and any terms that are unlikely to be known to the 'average' reader (e.g. a random second-year CS student).
